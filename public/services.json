        "description": "I've been teaching for 2 years - and A level photography specifically for 12 of those. I teach classes of about 32 students, in 14 hours a week. I don't teach Photoshop at all (though of course my students are freely permitted to use it). I teach my students these seven basic elements of photographic art: line, shape, form, texture, color, size, and depth. As a photographic artist, your knowledge and awareness of these different elements can be vital to the success of your composition and help convey the meaning of your photograph."
